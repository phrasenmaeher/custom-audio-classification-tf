# Custom audio classification with TensorFlow
These four notebooks contain an end-to-end audio classification project. 

The [first notebook](custaudio_data_acquisition.ipynb) starts with acquiring the data. The [second notebook]() creates a custom audio dataset. The [third notebook](custaudio_tfr_generation.ipynb) creates a TFRecord based dataset. The final [fourth notebook](custaudio_training.ipynb) trains a CNN on the data. The accompanying post explaining the code is available on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/custom-audio-classification-with-tensorflow-af8c16c38689).
